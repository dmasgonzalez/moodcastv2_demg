            Welcome to Moodcast,the webapp that provides you with new podcasts based on your mood - anywhere, anytime. 
            Conceived in the summer of 2017, the idea came to its creator from the frustration of discovering 
            <em>new</em> podcasts. Working through <em>General Assembly's Front End Web Development</em> course, 
            it became clear that creating podcast playlists based on a user's mood would be possible through 
            the coding methods and strategies discussed in this course.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, anyone can visit this page (once deployed online) to find podcasts best-suited to their current mood. 
          This page will continue to be built overtime, with new moods and podcasts added for your listening pleasure.
